# RedditMovieReviewer

Our tool is focusing on collecting reviews of a given movie name from reddit, process the text and analyze the userâ€™s sentiment towards the movie. We will finally give a score of the movie as evaluation from the sentiment analysis and show the comments with the strongest sentiment. 

## Details
We use sentiment analysis to decide each review is good or bad or not relative(neutral). Then we calculate the total score for a movie by count of good reviews/total count of reviews.

This is a cross-platform app about presenting Reddit users' opinions towards movies

## Abstract
### project purpose
Through the movie reviews/comments by Reddit users, we can analyze how the movie is accepted by the audiences.

### Project Motivation
- When people want to know the quality of a movie, they usually check the professional sites. However, the movie reviews there are always too professional and can't give users a genuine feeling of how other people think of the movie.
- Comments from social media are realatively easy to understand, so I decide to make an analyzer that can rate the movie based on the reviews from audience on social media.
