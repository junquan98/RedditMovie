# RedditMovie

This is a cross-platform app about presenting Reddit users' opinions towards movies

## Abstract
### project purpose
Through the movie reviews/comments by Reddit users, we can analyze how the movie is accepted by the audiences.

### Project Motivation
- When people want to know the quality of a movie, they usually check the professional sites. However, the movie reviews there are always too professional and can't give users a genuine feeling of how other people think of the movie.
